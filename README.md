Script to push printscreen's from a automated machine software into a server.

This script is very specific for a specific sofware. This script makes my life a little easier.

What this script makes is wait that a Sofware is in the Graphic from a industrial oven and uses the snipping tool to take a screenshot of this graphic and saves it to a server path.
